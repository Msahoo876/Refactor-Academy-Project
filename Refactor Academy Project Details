Ecommerce Customers Data Analysis:- 
            Actually this is project for data analysis of customer and try to guess which platform is best for this ecommerce side. Using Pandas and Seaborn 
            we are performing The EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis). In this we are using linear regression model so we get 98% final accuracy.
            Conclusion of this project :-
            -----------------------------
            based on feature importance bar plot we can find that time spend on the app is more important as compare to time spend on web that conclude that we 
            should focus more on app as campare to web but we should not abandon the web too.

            ElasticNet with scaled feature work best as a model best on the r2_score.
            R2 Score of this project is 0.9861
